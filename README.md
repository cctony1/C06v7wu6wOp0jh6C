In this short project, I take a look at customer satisfaction surveys.

Goals: 
1. Build a model that achieves >73% accuracy in predicting if a customer is truly happy or not based on the survey results.
2. Identify insignificant features (survey questions) that may be excluded in future surveys.

I achieved an accuracy of 83%, with f1 scores of 0.84 and 0.83 for the unhappy and happy customers, respectively.

The final model included 3 classifiers combined using weights in a soft Voting Classifier.

Although the goals were achieved, some variation in the results will be observed for different random seeds (e.g., in train/test split). More consistent results may require a larger dataset.
